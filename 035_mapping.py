# Mapping is going through a list and converting ('mapping')
# each item to another item. This is useful when you want
# to perform the same operation across a list of items.

# For example:

# * Getting the price of each in a list of products
# * Making each in a list of words uppercase
# * Finding the first letter of each in a list of words

# Here's an example:

words = ['I', 'need', 'another', 'five', 'years']

first_letters = []  # This is our accumulator again

for word in words:  # We go through each word
  first_letter = word[0]  # Get the first letter
  # And append it to our accumulator list:
  first_letters.append(first_letter)

print(words)
print(first_letters)

# @TASK: run this program to see what it does.

# @TASK: Complete this exercise.
