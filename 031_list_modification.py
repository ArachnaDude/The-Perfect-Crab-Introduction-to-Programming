# Python comes with a number of helpful functions to work
# with lists. We'll look at some that modify lists.

# Let's look at `append` first:

my_list = ["a", "b", "c"]
my_list.append("d")
print(my_list)  # my_list is now ["a", "b", "c", "d"]

# The effect is straightforward enough — it adds an item to
# the list.

# But there is an unusual aspect to this code.

# Consider this code with numbers:

my_num = 3
my_num + 1
print(my_num)  # my_num is still 3

# `my_num` stays `3` here because in the above code we're
# not assigning the result of the expression to a variable.

# However, in our list code:

my_list = ["a", "b", "c"]
my_list.append("d")
print(my_list)  # my_list is now ["a", "b", "c", "d"]

# `my_list` gets magically changed without an assignment!

# The behaviour of append is to modify the list 'in-place'.
# Don't worry too much about this right now. If you have any
# trouble with it, you can always create a new list by using
# the `copy` method.

my_list = ["a", "b", "c"]
my_copy = my_list.copy()
my_copy.append("d")
print(my_list)  # my_list is still ["a", "b", "c"]
print(my_copy)  # my_copy is now   ["a", "b", "c", "d"]

# But mostly you won't need to worry about it just yet.

# @TASK Do these exercises.

# You'll need to research the right methods to use. Here's
# a useful resource: https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/datastructures.html

# I've started it for you.
