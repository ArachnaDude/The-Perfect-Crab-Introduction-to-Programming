# Summarising is processing down a list to a single value.
# It is sometimes also called 'reduce' — like reducing a
# broth to a thick soup.

# Here are some examples:

# * Summing a list of numbers
# * Counting the number of 'q's in a string
# * Concatenating a list of strings

# I'm going to implement the last one, so you can see it at
# work:

lines = [
  "My King,", "I need another five years.", "Then your crab will be ready.",
  "Sincerely,", "Chuang-tzu"
]

text = ""  # This is called the accumulator variable
# It's where we put our summary value
# It starts off blank.

for line in lines:  # We go through lines item by item
  # Inside this loop, `line` is the individual line
  text = text + line  # We append the line to our text
  text = text + "\n"  # We add an `\n`, which means 'new line'

print(text)

# We have taken the list of strings and joined them all
# together into one text (the accumulator) with some new
# lines in it.

# There's actually a Python function that does this too:

another_text = "\n".join(lines)
# Uncomment this next line if you want to see it
print(another_text)

# `join` is actually little smarter — it only adds the `\n`
# character between lines, not at the end also.

# @TASK: Complete this exercise

print("")
print("Function: add_up_numbers")


# Add up all the numbers in the list
def add_up_numbers(numbers):
  sum = 0
  for i in numbers:
    sum += i
  return sum
